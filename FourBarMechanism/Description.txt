The method used to derive the equations of the four bar mechanism in the code is the closed loop method. Where the sum of the vectors r_1 and r_4 equals the sum of the vectors r2 and r_3.
By using this equation and setting the sum of lengths of r_1 and r_4 in the x-direction equal to the sum of lengths of r_2 and r_3 in the x-direction and sdoing the same in the y direction, we get two equations in 2 variables (theta2 and theta3).
The problem is that solving these two ecuations computationally is almost impossible so we relied on the graphical solution.
We put theta4 as a function of theta3 from the two equations and brute forces all values of theta3 to get the intersection points between the two curves.
Wether there was 1 or 2 intersection points, the pionts of intersection are all valid solutions.
Using the angles we got, and the values already given (r1, r2, r3, r4, theta2, omega2, and alpha2) we can get all other unknowns by differentiating the 2 original equations 2 times. and solving them again.
